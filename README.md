# Genetic Programming in C

## Introduction

This is an implementation of a genetic algorithm in C

## Problems

### The infinite monkey theorem

The infinite monkey theorem says that a monkey randomly hitting keys on a typewriter will eventually type out one of William Shakespeare's works.

### The knapsack problem

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## Compiling and running

### Configuring build

In the make file the `CC` variable contains the compiler, this can be changed to `clang` instead of `gcc`

```Makefile

CC = gcc
CFLAGS := -g -Wall -Wextra -pedantic

```

To change the executable name in the makefile there is a variable called `EXEC` that controls the name.

```Makefile

...
EXEC := main
...

```

#### Linux

- Compile with the `make` command: `make -j$(nproc)` or just `make`
- Run `./main` or the name specified in the Makefile

#### Windows and Mac
